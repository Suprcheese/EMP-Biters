Version: 1.0.0 - First public release
Date: 26. 3. 2016
  Major Features:
    - Now, large biters have a chance to give off an EMP blast when they die, temporarily disabling nearby turrets, radars, and logistic & construction robots. Large spitters also have a chance to EMP with their spit.
      The larger the enemy and the higher the evolution factor, the bigger the chance of EMP is.
