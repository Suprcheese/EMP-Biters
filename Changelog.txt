Version 1.0.0 - March 26, 2016
------------------------------
Now, large biters have a chance to give off an EMP blast when they die, temporarily disabling nearby turrets, radars, and logistic & construction robots. Large spitters also have a chance to EMP with their spit.
The larger the enemy and the higher the evolution factor, the bigger the chance of EMP is.


Version 1.0.1 - March 27, 2016
------------------------------
Increased default difficulty settings: all EMP attacks have increased disable duration.
To compensate, gun turrets are now disabled by EMP for only half as long as other entities. This should encourage using mixed defenses.


Version 1.0.2 - March 28, 2016
------------------------------
Added support for the 5dim Battlefield mod and its new enemies.
Fixed a crash that could happen when picking up a structure that was disabled by EMP.
Fixed Big Worms' chance to cause an EMP being lower than intended; their chance now increases from 0% at 0% evolution and reaches 100% by 50% evolution -- previously they would not reach 100% chance until 100% evo.


Version 1.0.3 - March 31, 2016
------------------------------
Fixed a crash that could happen when a radar-type entity was disabled by EMP.


Version 1.0.4 - May 4, 2016
---------------------------
Added support for Bob's Enemies 0.12.7.
