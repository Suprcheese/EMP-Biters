Version 1.0.0 - March 26, 2016
------------------------------
Now, large biters have a chance to give off an EMP blast when they die, temporarily disabling nearby turrets, radars, and logistic & construction robots. Large spitters also have a chance to EMP with their spit.
The larger the enemy and the higher the evolution factor, the bigger the chance of EMP is.


Version 1.0.1 - March 27, 2016
------------------------------
Increased default difficulty settings: all EMP attacks have increased disable duration.
To compensate, gun turrets are now disabled by EMP for only half as long as other entities. This should encourage using mixed defenses.
